# BinomialHeap
Implementation of the data-structure - Binomial Heap, with 'priority-queue'-like capabilities. 
Written in Java as an assignment given in 'Data Structures' course in University.

A Binomial Heap is a meldable heap defined as a Linked-List of Binomial Trees,
Binomial Trees unique properties allows Binomial Heaps to achieve logarithmic asymptotic time-complexity bounds.
Full analysis and proofs of asymptotic bounds were lectured in the course and can be found online.
